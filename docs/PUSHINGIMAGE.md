## Instructions

The next phase for getting your custom Docker images deployed is to push them to your very own private container registry.

By now you will have provisioned an [Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (ECR) on AWS so now we have somewhere to push your Docker images.

### Step 1 - Ensure you have an image to push

Firstly we'll need to make sure we have a docker image of our application ready to push.

Let's push up an image of the Python app we worked with in session 3.

Navigate to the directory for that application (that you cloned in session 3).

It's on the link below if you need to re-clone

https://github.com/techreturners/devops-bookstore-api

### Step 2 - Build the docker image

Make sure Docker is running on your computer and build the docker image by running this command:

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t devops-bookstore-api:1.0 .
```

That will produce a local docker image. One that we can PUSH up to your container registry.

### Step 3 - Authenticating docker to allow the push

Next we need to make sure your local docker instance has the right credentials to push up to your container registry. 

Run the following command to authenticate your local Docker instance

Replace the AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with the ID of your AWS account. If you are unsure of this you can log into the AWS console and click your name at the top right and you'll see your account ID.

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 --profile terraform-iac | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

The above command assumes that you set up AWS credentials using a profile name of **terraform-iac**

**NOTE: Windows Users**

If you receive a "400 bad request error" it may be that you're using a Powershell command the login into your Docker registry. If that is the case then give this version of the login command a try. Remember to replace the AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual account ID.

```
powershell 'docker login --username AWS -p $(aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 --profile terraform-iac ) AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com'
```

### Step 4 - Tag your docker image with the location of your registry

The way you tell Docker about your container registries is through the tagging system.

You can tag the image you built in step 2 with a new tag for your container registry. To do this (replace the AWS_ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS account ID):

```
docker tag devops-bookstore-api:1.0 AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/devops-bookstore-api:1.0
```

You can see your Docker images by running `docker images` and you should see your tagged version.

### Step 5 - Push your image

Once the image has been tagged and you have configured docker to be authenticated with your account you should be able to push your image.

```
docker push AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/devops-bookstore-api:1.0
```

If all works you should see it show progress of your "push"

### Step 6 - Check the image through your AWS console

If you then open up the AWS web console you should be able to navigate to the container registry and see your image. It should look similar to the image below:

![ECR Example Image](./images/ecr_example.png)

You can now head back to the [README](../README.md) and lets work through getting that image deployed.
